## 🧠 Overview

In today’s job market, estimating appropriate salaries is often subjective and inconsistent. This project uses supervised machine learning (regression) to build a predictive model based on historical employee data (e.g., age, education, occupation).

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Traditional methods for salary estimation are prone to bias and inconsistency.  
The goal is to develop a transparent, fair, and accurate system using machine learning that can estimate employee salaries based on objective data, helping HR professionals and platforms improve decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset

- CSV file containing employee information:
  - Age
  - Education Level
  - Occupation
  - Experience
  - Location
  - Salary (Target)

## ⚙️ System Approach

1. **Data Loading**: Loaded employee dataset from CSV.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values using mean imputation.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selected numerical and categorical features.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized correlations and distributions.
5. **Model Selection**: Applied regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.
6. **Training & Testing**: Split data, trained on 80%, tested on 20%.
7. **Evaluation Metrics**: 
   - R² Score (goodness of fit)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
